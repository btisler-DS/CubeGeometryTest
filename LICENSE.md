## PREAMBLE

This repository is not released as conventional “open source.”  
It is released as a **covenanted instrument**.

Its purpose is not distribution alone —

This code exists to model system dynamics, inquiry geometry, and structural behavior under bias.  
It is not offered as a commodity.  
It is offered as an instrument of understanding.

Use is permitted.  
Distortion is not.
