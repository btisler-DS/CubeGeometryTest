# Inquiry Studio v0.1 – Yann LeCun Cubes Backstop

Inquiry Studio is a question-centric AI design lab.

It does **not** train a giant model. Instead, it:

- Represents questions as structured objects (WWWWHW + Ω, Δ, Φ, Ψ)
- Tracks interrogative load as a **cube vector** (cubic AI)
- Routes questions through a reasoning engine (dummy or real)
- Applies a **backstop** that enforces mission rules, guardrails, and logging

The **Yann LeCun Cubes Backstop** is the supervising layer that:

- Preserves epistemic integrity (no false certainty)
- Prevents identity/agency drift
- Monitors cube dynamics (WWWWHW balance)
- Logs all state transitions for later analysis
