# Literature Scan — Transparency Document

This folder contains a literature scan conducted using the Elicit academic search system
to identify prior work relevant to geometric modeling of interrogative structure and
entropy-based analysis of question forms.

## Purpose

This report is included for **transparency and context only**.

It documents a search process used to:
- Identify adjacent research domains
- Check for architectural parallels
- Assess whether similar measurement instruments exist in current literature

This report does **not** function as:
- Validation of the instrument
- Peer review
- Proof of correctness
- Proof of originality
- Endorsement of claims

## What the Scan Looked For

The search process focused on identifying work involving:

- Geometric or spatial modeling of questions
- Entropy applied to interrogative structure (not responses)
- Deterministic representations of question form
- Use of classical interrogatives (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) as formal dimensions
- Question-as-program or symbolic interrogative systems
- Information-theoretic approaches to question selection

## Summary (From the Report)

The report found:

- No reviewed studies implement a six-dimensional field over classical interrogatives.
- No reviewed studies compute entropy over interrogative form instead of response distributions.
- No reviewed studies use deterministic spatial injections of questions into a geometric field.

Several related approaches were identified in adjacent research areas (e.g., information gain,
question-as-program modeling, symbolic reasoning evaluation), but none employed the geometric
architecture described in this repository.

## Interpretation

This document supports a **novelty reconnaissance effort**, not a novelty claim.

Absence of prior examples in this scan does not imply:
- Uniqueness
- Completeness of the search
- Superiority of approach
- Final novelty determination

It only indicates that no close structural matches were identified in the reviewed sample.

## Why This Is Included

This report is published here to:

- Show due diligence
- Provide literature context
- Encourage informed critique
- Enable collaborators to inspect the search scope

It is not cited as authority.

## How to Use This Document

If you are reviewing this repository:

- Treat this as background reconnaissance.
- Evaluate the instrument on its technical merits.
- Do not treat this document as evidence of correctness or validation.

Scientific value must rest on:
- Formal definition
- Reproducibility
- Measured behavior
- Independent replication

Not on absence of prior art.
